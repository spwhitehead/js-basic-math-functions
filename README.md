# js-basic-math-functions
A basic program to add, square, multiply numbers given from the user.

## Instructions:
Using javascript, write the functions listed below. These should be in a separate javascript file. Your html file needs to have two inputs where the user can put in two numbers, then four buttons to execute each of the math functions. When a function is called, it should display the result in some easy to see way. A simple alert is enough, though feel free to make something more elaborate.

Write a function add(x, y) that adds two numbers.

Write a function multiply(x, y) that multiplies two numbers.

Write a function square(x) that squares a number (note: it must use multiply).

Write a function addSquares(x, y) that adds the squares of two numbers (note: it must use both add and square).
